If you would like to switch from your personal credit card to a company card, or upgrade using a company credit card, you’ll need to do the following:

* [Change the credit card details]()
* [Update the billing email address]()
* [Set a new team admin (optional)]()

## If you don’t have access to a company credit card

The easiest thing to do is to [invite someone]() who has access to a company credit card, and who you’d like to use as the billing contact for the team. Then they can set up their account and [configure the billing details]().

For example, some customers invite accounting@foo.com or admin@foo.com.

## If you do have access to a company credit card

If you personally have access to a company credit card, you can add that card yourself and change the billing email after you’ve updated the card.

Just visit the [team billing page]() to add or update the team billing details.
