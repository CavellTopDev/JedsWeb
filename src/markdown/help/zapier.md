title: "Import data from integrations via Zapier"
---

Our Zapier integration lets you connect 1,000+ apps and services to Dovetail to centralize your research data and customer feedback in one place. For example, here are a few common use case for integrations:

* **Send @mentions to Dovetail** – When you’re mentioned on Twitter, save the tweet as a new note in Dovetail.
* **Save Typeform survey responses to Dovetail** – When someone responds to a question in a Typeform survey, append their answer to a note.
* **Save Intercom conversations in Dovetail** – When a new conversation is created in Intercom, save it as a note in Dovetail.

## Connect Dovetail & Zapier

The first thing you’ll need to do is connect to Zapier. If you haven’t got a Zapier account yet, sign up for free at zapier.com. When you start creating the integration you want, Zapier will ask you to connect Dovetail.

Click **Connect an Account** and you’ll be prompted to log in to Dovetail if you aren’t already logged in.

After logging in, you’ll need to approve Zapier’s request to access your Dovetail account. Just click **Approve** to continue.

Finally, the window will close and your Dovetail account will be connected with Zapier. If everything is good to go you’ll see this screen.

The next step is to continue setting up your Zap. Zapier’s documentation has detailed instructions on how to continue.
