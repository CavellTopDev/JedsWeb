It is Dovetail’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our Services. Accordingly, we have developed this privacy policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate, disclose, and otherwise make use of personal information. We have outlined our privacy policy below.

## GDPR Notice

On May 25, 2018, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) takes effect. GDPR regulates the governance of personal data for EU citizens with an emphasis on data security and privacy. The GDPR does not only apply to companies that operate in the EU. This regulation will also impact companies operating outside of the EU if they have any EU customers or personal data of anyone in the EU.

As an Australian business, we are already covered by the [Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2017C00283) (Privacy Act). The GDPR and the Privacy Act include some similar requirements. Both laws foster transparent information handling practices and business accountability, to give individuals confidence that their privacy is being protected. Both laws require businesses to implement measures that ensure compliance with a set of privacy principles, and both take a privacy by design approach to compliance.

Dovetail has made information security and data privacy foundational principles of everything we do, and we recognize the importance of passing regulations to advance information security and data privacy for citizens of the EU. We are firmly committed to GDPR readiness.
