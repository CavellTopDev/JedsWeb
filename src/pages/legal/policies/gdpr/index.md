## Introduction

On May 25, 2018, the European Unionâ€™s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) takes effect. GDPR regulates the governance of personal data for EU citizens with an emphasis on data security and privacy. The GDPR does not only apply to companies that operate in the EU. This regulation will also impact companies operating outside of the EU if they have any EU customers or personal data of anyone in the EU.

As an Australian business, we are already covered by the [Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2017C00283) (Privacy Act). The GDPR and the Privacy Act include some similar requirements. Both laws foster transparent information handling practices and business accountability, to give individuals confidence that their privacy is being protected. Both laws require businesses to implement measures that ensure compliance with a set of privacy principles, and both take a privacy by design approach to compliance.

Dovetail has made information security and data privacy foundational principles of everything we do, and we recognize the importance of passing regulations to advance information security and data privacy for citizens of the EU. We are firmly committed to GDPR readiness.

## Our preparations

Dovetail already complies with much of the GDPR, however there are several areas where we need to make improvements to be fully compliant by May 25, 2018. These include:

* Updating our [privacy policy](/legal/privacy) to include more information about what data we collect.
* Listing [third parties](/legal/data-subprocessors) we use to process data, and where they are located.
* Improving our [data export features](/help/export) for better data portability.
* Streamlining our deletion process to make it easier for users to delete their account.
* Getting explict consent of our user terms of service and privacy policy.
* Storing the timestamp when consent was explicitly given.

We will be releasing these improvements continually over the weeks leading up to May 25, 2018, and we expect to be fully compliant with the GDPR by then.
