It’s easy to get swamped by the amount of information on qualitative research available online. Articles about qualitative research methods often use complex academic language and dance around the details of how to run qualitative research projects.

This article lists a range of qualitative research methods. It briefly explains each method and includes rough guidelines on what you need to incorporate each one into your own qualitative research. Books have been written about each method listed here – this article will not go into that much detail!

Before we dive in, a quick recap on qualitative research from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research):

> As a field of study, qualitative approaches include research concepts and methods from multiple established academic fields. The aim of a qualitative research project may vary with the disciplinary background, such as a psychologist seeking in-depth understanding of human behavior and the reasons that govern such behavior for example. Qualitative methods are best for researching many of the why and how questions of human experience, in making a decision for example (not just what, where, when, or "who"); and have a strong basis in the field of sociology to understand government and social programs. Qualitative research is widely used by political science, social work, and education researchers.

## Structured Interviews

One of the most common qualitative research methods, especially in a commercial setting, [structured interviews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_interview) are interviews with a participant where the set of questions, the wording of questions, and the order of questions are consistent between each interview. Structured interviews are considered a means by which researchers can increase the reliability and credibility of their research data.

**What you’ll be doing:** Planning, scheduling, taking notes, analyzing.

**Suggested tools:** [Calendly](https://calendly.com/), [Dovetail](/).

**Participants required:** 6 – 12 participants.

**Time required:** 30 – 90 minutes per interview.

**Prep and analysis:** 3+ hours.

## Unstructured Interviews

[Unstructured interviews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unstructured_interview) are similar to structured interviews however they follow a looser format. The set of questions, wording, and order may vary wildly between each interview. Unstructured interviews are more like a free-flowing conversation, and as such, they’re more prone to go down rabbit holes. However, due to their relaxed nature, it might be easier to get truthful information out of a participant.

**What you’ll be doing:** Planning, scheduling, taking notes, analyzing.

**Suggested tools:** [Calendly](https://calendly.com/), [Dovetail](/).

**Participants required:** 1 – 12 participants.

**Time required:** 15 – 60 minutes per interview.

**Prep and analysis:** 3+ hours.

## Usability Testing

[Usability testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_testing) (also known as User testing) is used to measure the ease of use of a software user interface or a product. It’s a form of systematic observation focusing on measuring a human-made product’s capacity to meet its intended purpose. Examples of products that commonly benefit from usability testing are food, consumer products, web sites or web applications, computer interfaces, documents, and devices.

Participants are given a task to achieve and are observed trying to complete the task. The testing session can range from rigorous (taking place in a ‘lab’ setting), to fast and dirty, which is sometimes called ‘hallway testing’ or ‘guerilla testing’.

**What you’ll be doing:** Planning, scheduling, testing, recording, taking notes, analyzing.

**Suggested tools:** [Calendly](https://calendly.com/), [Lookback](https://lookback.io/), [Dovetail](/), [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/), [Sketch](https://sketchapp.com/).

**Participants required:** 5 – 20 participants.

**Time required:** 30 – 60 minutes per session.

**Prep and analysis:** 8+ hours.

## Surveys

A [survey](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survey_(human_research)>) is simply a list of questions aimed at extracting specific data from a particular group of people. Questions can result in quantitative data (e.g. single choice, multiple choice, likert scale) or qualitative data (open-ended questions).

Surveys are often used in market and user research to determine thoughts, feelings, and opinions from a sample of people. The design of your questions and the relevance of respondents greatly affects the quality of your data, however creating effective surveys is an enormous topic that we won’t try to cover here.

**What you’ll be doing:** Creating a survey, finding people, analyzing responses.

**Suggested tools:** [Typeform](https://typeform.com/), [Dovetail](/).

**Participants required:** 20 – 1,000+ participants.

**Time required:** Surveys typically take 5 – 30 minutes to complete.

**Prep and analysis:** 2+ hours.

## Contextual Inquiries

Often research takes place in the researcher’s environment. For example, participants might visit your office for a usability test. A [contextual inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_inquiry), on the other hand, is where the researcher interviews or observes a participant in the course of their normal activities in their own environment.

For example, a contextual inquiry might involve visiting a customer’s office and seeing how their users interact with your software, or visiting a hospital or school and observing doctors or students.

**What you’ll be doing:** Planning, recruiting, scheduling, note-taking, recording, analyzing.

**Suggested tools:** Audio recorder, camera, pen and paper, [Calendly](https://calendly.com/), [Dovetail](/).

**Participants required:** 1 – 10 participants.

**Time required:** 2 – 3 hours.

**Prep and analysis:** 6+ hours.

## Persona Development

A [persona](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/personas.html) is a fictional character that is a realistic representation of someone in your audience. Personas have a name, an appearance, opinions, emotions, and demographic data like a location, job, income, etc.

Personas are used as a method in qualitative user research to help focus decisions by adding a layer of real-world consideration to the conversation. They also offer a quick and inexpensive way to test and prioritize features throughout development.

Personas are created based on real user research using the methods listed in this article.

**What you’ll be doing:** Researching, analyzing data, and creating personas.

**Suggested tools:** Audio recorder, camera, pen and paper, [Dovetail](/).

**Participants required:** 5 – 20 participants.

**Time required:** Depends on methods used.

**Prep and analysis:** 12+ hours.

## Focus Groups

[Focus groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_group) are like interviews, except rather than being one-on-one, focus groups are conducted with a group of demographically diverse people. Questions are asked in an interactive group setting where participants are free to talk with other group members.

Focus groups are used a lot in market research and political research, but they are heavily criticised in the user research community for their problems with [observer bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer-expectancy_effect), tendencies towards [groupthink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink), vocal participants dominating the discussion, and serving purely as a means to appease stakeholders. Apple’s Jony Ive said focus groups “ensure that you don’t offend anyone, and produce bland inoffensive products.”

**What you’ll be doing:** Recruiting, running the session, note-taking, recording, analyzing.

**Suggested tools:** Audio recorder, video camera, [Calendly](https://calendly.com/), [Dovetail](/).

**Participants required:** 5 – 15 participants.

**Time required:** Focus groups usually take 1 – 3 hours.

**Prep and analysis:** 12+ hours.
