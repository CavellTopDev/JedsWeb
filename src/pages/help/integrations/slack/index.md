Did someone drop an interesting idea, a feature suggestion, or customer feedback in your Slack channel? Save it along with your other feedback and feature requests so you can prioritize accordingly. When you react to a message using the Slack emoji you select when setting this Zap up, this Zapier integration will automatically save the message it as a new note in Dovetail.

### How this Slack-Dovetail integration works
