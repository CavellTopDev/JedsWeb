Don’t lose your valuable Intercom conversations. Instead, store it all in the same place for easy analysis and sharing. This Zapier integration creates a new note in Dovetail when a conversation is closed in Intercom, and copies across a link to the discussion, and the contents of the chat.

*Note: The “Reply and close” button won't trigger this. You must reply and then close the conversation separately.*

### How this Intercom-Dovetail integration works

1. A new conversation is closed in Intercom
2. Zapier saves the contents of the conversation to a note in Dovetail

### Apps involved

- Intercom
- Dovetail
