Got customer feedback or user research data in your webhook-powered app? Import it directly into Dovetail via a Zapier webhook integration. Whenever new data comes in from your webhook, Zapier will use it to add a new note to Dovetail. Keep track of user feedback and feature requests, shape your ideas, and prioritize them in Dovetail.
