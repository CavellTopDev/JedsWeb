The power of Dovetail lies in inline tagging, which we call **highlighting**. There are two types of highlights: [**tags**](/help/tags) and [**insights**](/help/insights).

Highlights are added to content inside **notes**. Unlike other products, with Dovetail, you could highlight a single word, sentence, or paragraph with a tag or insight. This means you can add more granular tags or insights to content.

## What to use insights for

Insights are used to summarize your findings.

For example, if you were analyzing reviews for an iPhone app, you might find that lots of people have been requesting a search feature, however comparatively few people have mentioned slow performance as a problem.

You could create an insight summarizing this lesson – _“Our users ask for search 5x more than they mention slow performance.”_ Then, you can choose highlights from tags that back up this insight, and add them to the insight. Insights are also designed to have a longer description than tags, so you can describe your insight in detail for others.

**Note:** New insights can either be created in-context as you highlight a note, or as a blank insight inside a project. The instructions below are for the former method.
