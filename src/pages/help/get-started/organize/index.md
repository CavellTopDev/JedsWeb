Dovetail has tags, notes, insights, groups, projects, and teams. There are many ways to organize your content using these concepts. From bottom to top, here’s an explanation of each concept:

**Tags** — Annotations created on text in notes.

**Notes** — Text documents where you can take research notes, paste textual data to analyze, or automatically import via Zapier.

**Insights** — A special type of note designed to store research findings.

**Groups** — A way to categorize notes, tags, and insights inside a project. Useful for highlighting themes or as a workflow with drag & drop.

**Projects** — Contain notes, tags, insights, and groups. Projects are generally topic-based, e.g. a research project or a specific product’s feedback.

**Teams** — Allow multiple people to access projects.

## Example workflow

Here’s an example workflow of how you might use Dovetail for analysis:

1.  Create a project for a research focus area.
1.  Write your own notes, import data from [a spreadsheet](/help/import) or from [Zapier](/help/zapier), or paste text from elsewhere to analyze in Dovetail.
1.  As you identify themes across notes, annotate your notes with tags.
1.  Use groups to categorize notes and tags.
1.  Write about your findings in editorial insights.
1.  Share your research with teammates, stakeholders, or clients.
