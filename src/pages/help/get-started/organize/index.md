Not unlike Trello, Google Docs, or a spreadsheet, Dovetail is intentionally designed to be a very flexible tool in order to work with a variety of use cases for customer feedback and user research organization and analysis.

It’s important to understand the purpose of each of the key features and concepts present in the product — and how they relate to one another — so you can make an informed decision on how to organize content for your use case.
