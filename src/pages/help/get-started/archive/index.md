Completed projects can be archived to keep your list of projects tidy and signal to others that the project has ended. To archive a project:

1.  Open the project youâ€™d like to archive.
1.  Click the **More menu** (three dots) in the top right.
1.  Click **Archive**.

A few things to note:

* Archived projects can still be used like normal.
* Once a project is archived, a message will appear on the top of the project.
* Feedback forms and Zapier integrations will continue to work.
* Projects must be archived before they can be deleted.
