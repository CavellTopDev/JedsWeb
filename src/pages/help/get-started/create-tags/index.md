The power of Dovetail lies in inline tagging, which we call **annotating**. There are two types of annotations: [**tags**](/help/tags) and [**insights**](/help/insights).

Annotations are added to content inside **notes**. Unlike other products, with Dovetail, you could annotate a single word, sentence, or paragraph with a tag or insight. This means you can add more granular tags or insights to content.

## What to use tags for

Tags are used to keep track of patterns that emerge across notes.

For example, let’s say you were analyzing reviews for an iPhone app. Each note in Dovetail is one review. Here’s the content of one of the reviews:

> “I love the app, however it’s becoming slower and slower. It seems to take a long time to open up initially. It’s missing a key feature – search. I need this to find what I need.”

Given this example, perhaps you’d tag _“…however it’s becoming slower and slower. It seems to take a long time to open up initially”_ with **performance** and _“It’s missing a key feature – search. I need this to find what I need”_ with **feature request**.

**Note:** New tags can either be created in-context as you annotate a note, or as a blank tag inside a project. The instructions below are for the former method.
