## About teams

In Dovetail, every user must belong to a team. Projects also belongs to a team, not users. When you create a new account, we’ll create a new team for you. You can then [invite other users](/help/invite) to join your team.

When someone leaves a team (including yourself), we create a new team for them and any projects stay with the original team. **If you accept an invite to join another team, you will lose access to projects created in your original team.**

## Remove yourself

You can remove yourself from a team. When you do this, we’ll immediately create a new team for you which will initially consist of just yourself. You’ll lose access to any projects in the team you left.

To remove yourself from the team:

1.  Visit the **[team members page](/team/members)**.
1.  Click the **✕** next to yourself.
1.  Click **Remove**.

## Remove other people

The team admin can remove anyone from the team. When you remove someone, they will no longer have access to projects in your team.

To remove someone from your team:

1.  Visit the **[team members page](/team/members)**.
1.  Click the **✕** next to someone.
1.  Click **Remove**.
