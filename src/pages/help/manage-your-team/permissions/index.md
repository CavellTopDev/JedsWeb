**Note:** We have plans on [our roadmap](https://trello.com/b/B0Mua1tB/public-roadmap) to replace this system with a new permissions feature with multiple admins, billing access control, and per-project access control.

**Everyone** in the team can:

- View all projects and notes.
- Create new projects and notes.
- Archive projects.
- Delete projects and notes.
- Invite other team members.
- Remove themselves from the team.
- Manage the team subscription.
- Add and remove credit cards.

**The team admin** can:

- Do all of the above.
- Remove others from the team.
