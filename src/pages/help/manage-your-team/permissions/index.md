## About teams

In Dovetail, every user must belong to a team. Projects also belongs to a team, not users. When you create a new account, weâ€™ll create a new team for you. You can then [invite other users](/help/invite) to join your team.

When someone leaves a team (including yourself), we create a new team for them and any projects stay with the original team. **If you accept an invite to join another team, you will lose access to projects created in your original team.**

## The team admin

The admin is the person who initially created the team. If they leave the team, then the next person who joined will become the admin.

[Contact us](mailto:hello@dovetailapp.com) to change the team admin.
