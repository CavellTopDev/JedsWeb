The team admin is the person who initially created the team. Admins have the same [permissions](/help/permissions) as users, except they can remove anyone from the team, whereas users can only remove themselves. [Contact us](mailto:hello@dovetailapp.com) to change the team admin.

**Note:** We have plans on [our roadmap](https://dovetailapp.com/roadmap) to replace this system with a new permissions feature with multiple admins, billing access control, and per-project access control.
