You can modify your credit card, change where receipts are sent, and switch to annual billing directly in Dovetail without having to contact us.

## Add a credit card

When you decide you’d like to upgrade to a paid subscription, you can choose to pay once every month or once every year (annual billing). Note that when you make a payment, you’re paying for that period in advance.

1.  Visit the **[team billing page](/team/billing)**.
1.  Click **Upgrade for $49 / month** or **Upgrade for $588 / year**.
1.  Enter your name and address exactly as it appears on your card.
1.  Enter your credit card number, expiry, and CVV.
1.  Click **Pay** to upgrade and make the first payment.

## Change your card details

When you add a new credit card, we’ll replace your old card. Your new card will be charged at the start of the next billing period.

1.  Visit the **[team billing page](/team/billing)**.
1.  Click **Edit** next to **Credit card**.
1.  Enter your name and address exactly as it appears on your card.
1.  Enter your credit card number, expiry, and CVV.
1.  Click **Update credit card** to save the new details.

## Change where receipts are sent

The team billing email is the contact person for payment receipts, pricing updates, and other important announcements.

1.  Visit the **[team billing page](/team/billing)**.
1.  Click **Edit** next to **Billing email**.
1.  Enter a new valid email address.
1.  Click **Save**.

## Switch from monthly to annual billing

If you’re on a monthly plan and would like to simplify your payments, feel free to switch from monthly to annual billing.

When you switch, we’ll charge you for a year’s subscription minus the cost of any remaining days left in the current billing period. Please note that only team admins can switch from monthly to annual billing.

1.  Visit the **[team billing page](/team/billing)**.
1.  Click **Switch to annual** next to **Plan**.
1.  In the modal dialog, click **Switch to annual billing**.
