You can pay for your subscription automatically with a credit card or by invoice. Please note that invoice-based billing is only available on our Enterprise plan.

## Pay automatically

[Upgrade your team to a paid subscription](/help/billing) and choose **Pay by card** during the checkout flow. We’ll securely send your credit card details to our payments provider Stripe, who will automatically charge the card at the beginning of each billing period.

## Pay by invoice

If you choose to pay your Enterprise subscription by invoice, you’ll receive an email containing the payment instructions at the start of each billing period.

You can pay the invoice immediately by credit card (recommended) or you can wire a USD payment to our bank account in Australia:

- **Bank name:** Commonwealth Bank of Australia
- **BIC/SWIFT Code:** CTBAAU2S
- **BSB:** 06 2948
- **Account:** 2023 9689
- **IBAN:** 06294820239689
