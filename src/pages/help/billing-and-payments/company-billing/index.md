If you would like to switch from your personal credit card to a company card, or upgrade using a company credit card, you’ll need to do the following:

* [Change the credit card details](/help/billing)
* [Update the billing email address](/help/billing)
* [Set a new team admin (optional)](/help/billing)

## If you don’t have access to a company credit card

The easiest thing to do is to [invite someone](/help/invite) who has access to a company credit card, and who you’d like to use as the billing contact for the team. Then they can set up their account and [configure the billing details](/help/billing).

For example, some customers invite accounting@foo.com or admin@foo.com.

## If you do have access to a company credit card

If you personally have access to a company credit card, you can add that card yourself and change the billing email after you’ve updated the card.

Just visit the [team billing page](/team/billing) to add or update the team billing details.
