If you would like to switch from your personal credit card to a company card, or upgrade using a company credit card, you’ll need to do the following:

1.  [Change the credit card details to a company card](/help/billing)
2.  [Update the billing email address to an accounting or IT contact](/help/billing)
3.  [Set the team admin as someone from accounting or IT (optional)](/help/admin)

### If you don’t have access to a company card

The easiest thing to do is to [invite someone](/help/invite) who has access to a company credit card, and who you’d like to use as the billing contact for the team. Then they can set up their account and [configure the billing details](/help/billing).

For example, some customers invite accounting@acme.com or admin@acme.com.

### If you do have access to a company card

If you personally have access to a company credit card, you can add that card yourself and change the billing email to any email after you’ve updated the card.

Just visit the [team billing page](/team/billing) to add or update the team billing details.
