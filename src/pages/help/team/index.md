In Dovetail, every user must belong to a team. Project data also belongs to a team, not users. When you create an account, we’ll create a new team for you. You can then invite other users to join your team.

When someone leaves a team (including yourself), we create a new team for them and any projects stay with the original team.

## Remove yourself

You can remove yourself from a team. When you do this, we’ll immediately create a new team for you which will initially consist of just yourself. You’ll lose access to any projects in the team you left.

To remove yourself from the team:

1.  Visit the **[team members page](/team/members)**.
1.  Click the **✕** next to yourself.
1.  Click **Remove**.

## The team admin

The admin is the person who initially created the team. If they leave the team, then the next person who joined will become the admin.

[Contact us](mailto:hello@dovetailapp.com) to change the team admin.

## Remove other people

The team admin can remove anyone from the team. When you remove someone, they will no longer have access to projects in your team.

To remove someone from your team:

1.  Visit the **[team members page](/team/members)**.
1.  Click the **✕** next to someone.
1.  Click **Remove**.

## Permissions

**Everyone** in the team can:

* View all projects and notes,
* Create new projects and notes,
* Delete projects and notes,
* Invite other team members,
* Remove themselves from the team, and
* Add a credit card.

**The team admin** can:

* Do all of the above, and
* Remove others from the team.
