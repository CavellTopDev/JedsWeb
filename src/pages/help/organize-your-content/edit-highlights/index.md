Dovetail offers a bulk editing mode to help you move highlights around and re-organize your tags and insights. Using bulk editing, you can merge two tags or insights together, add highlights to insights, or remove a tag or insight from multiple highlights at once.

To enter bulk editing mode, visit a tag or insight and click **Edit multiple**:
