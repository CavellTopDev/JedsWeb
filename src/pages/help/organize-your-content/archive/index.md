Completed projects can be **archived** to keep your list of projects tidy and signal to others that the project has ended. A few things to note:

- Archived projects are **read only**, however any feedback forms or outstanding Zapier integrations will continue to work normally.
- Once a project is archived, a lozenge will appear next to the project title.
- Projects must be archived before they can be deleted.
