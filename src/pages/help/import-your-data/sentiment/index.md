Sentiment analysis is when software analyzes text and determines whether it expresses positive or negative sentiment. Dovetail can automatically analyze the sentiment of your data at the sentence-level.

## How it works

Dovetail will add _Positive_ and _Negative_ tags to sentences in notes that express a strong positive or negative sentiment. For example, let’s say you had the following piece of user feedback:

> “Hi guys. I love the product overall. It has a very clean design. But I really hate that I can’t search my data.”

“I love the product overall” and “It has a very clean design” are strongly positive, so they will be tagged with _Positive_. “But I really hate that I can’t search my data” is negative, so it will be tagged with _Negative_. “Hi guys” will not be tagged because it does not show a strong sentiment either way.

## Enabling sentiment analysis

Automatic sentiment analysis can be enabled when you import data using any of the following methods:

- [Uploading a spreadsheet with data](/help/spreadsheet)
- [Importing data through a Zapier integration](/help/zapier)
