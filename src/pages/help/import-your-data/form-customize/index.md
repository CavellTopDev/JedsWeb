Gather valuable feedback from your users with a simple, customizable, and embeddable form. When people fill it out, their feedback is saved in your Dovetail project, ready to organize and analyze alongside everything else.

If you want to try this feature, just click the **Feedback** button in-product! We use our own embeddable feedback form to get feedback from our users.
