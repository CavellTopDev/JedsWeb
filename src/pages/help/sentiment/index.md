title: "Analyze the sentiment of imported data"

Sentiment analysis is when software analyzes text and determines whether it expresses positive or negative sentiment. Dovetail can automatically analyze the sentiment of your data at the sentence-level.

## How it works

Dovetail will add _Positive_ and _Negative_ tags to sentences in notes that express a strong positive or negative sentiment. For example, let’s say you had the following piece of user feedback:

> “Hi guys. I love the product overall. It has a very clean design. But I really hate that I can’t search my data.”

“I love the product overall” and “It has a very clean design” are strongly positive, so they will be tagged with _Positive_. “But I really hate that I can’t search my data” is negative, so it will be tagged with _Negative_. “Hi guys” will not be tagged because it does not show a strong sentiment either way.

## Enabling sentiment analysis

Automatic sentiment analysis can be enabled when you import data using any of the following methods:

* [Uploading a spreadsheet with data]()
* [Collecting feedback through an embeddable form]()
